#Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Python. (It is true that Python has the max() function built in, but writing it yourself is nevertheless a good exercise.)

def max1(num1,num2):
    return num1 if num1>num2 else num2


print (max1(4,7))
